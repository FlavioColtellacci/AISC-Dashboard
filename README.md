## Project Overview

An end-to-end Business Intelligence solution for mining operations cost analysis, tracking **All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC)** — the gold-standard metric for mining company competitiveness. Built to demonstrate financial analytics capabilities for Perth's mining sector (BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue).

**Business Problem:** Mining operators must track AISC to remain competitive. Bottom-quartile cost producers survive commodity downturns while high-cost producers shut down. This dashboard tracks AISC by site, identifies cost reduction opportunities, and models sensitivity to ore grade changes.

---

## Key Business Insights

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Site A AISC** | $188.98/t | ✅ Bottom Quartile (Competitive) |
| **Site B AISC** | $216.36/t | ⚠️ Top Quartile (Needs Intervention) |
| **Site C AISC** | $199.65/t | ✅ Second Quartile (Acceptable) |
| **Ore Grade Impact** | ±0.5% grade = ±$11-13/t AISC | 📈 High Sensitivity |
| **Seasonal Effect** | Q1 costs +8% vs Q2-Q4 | ⛈️ Cyclone Season Impact |
| **Cost Structure** | Processing (47%) + Mining (37%) = 84% | 🎯 Optimization Focus |

## Data Model

**Star Schema Design:**

```
           DimSite ──────┐
                         │
           DimDate ──────┼────→ FactCosts (288 records)
                         │
     DimCostCategory ────┘
```

**Fact Table:** FactCosts (3 sites × 24 months × 4 cost categories)

**Dimensions:**
- DimSite: 3 mine sites (Pilbara, Goldfields, Mid-West WA)
- DimDate: 24 months (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
- DimCostCategory: 4 categories (Mining, Processing, G&A, Sustaining CapEx)

---

## 📈 Key DAX Measures

### 1. AISC per Tonne (Primary Metric)
```dax
AISC per Tonne = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactCosts[TotalCost_Actual]),
    SUM(FactCosts[UniqueTonnes])
)
```

### 2. Budget Variance %
```dax
Budget Variance % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Budget Variance],
    SUM(FactCosts[TotalCost_Budget])
)
```

### 3. AISC with Sensitivity (What-If Analysis)
```dax
AISC with Sensitivity = 
VAR Adjustment = SELECTEDVALUE('Ore Grade Adjustment'[Ore Grade Adjustment], 0)
RETURN [AISC per Tonne] * (1 + (Adjustment * -0.12))
```
